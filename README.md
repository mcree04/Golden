# We are interested in what challenges you encountered in coding and if you found a way to overcome them or go around them.

I ... don't think I got enough done in the time limit I was given. I probably could've done a lot more. I don't have anything to say about it other than excuses. I wanted to get a lot more done, and then my motivation tanked, I had to deal with family matters, and other stuff. All just excuses. But still, I tried my best to get done what I could. 

I learned a lot during this process - I've never made anything on my own before, not like this. Every time I would make something it'd be a pre-assigned project for a class, or it would have so many restrictions there weren't many choices. But here I could do many things, and make something to be proud of. I've always loved game development and storytelling and I was glad to have the chance to work on something in that field. I doubt I could make it as a game developer, but if I did it on the side I think I'd be happy.  I learned about what that process is like, I learned more about time management and why it's important, and I figured out how to actually make something such as a visual novel. It's so satisfying to be able to say I made something, even if it seems pretty simple or silly. 

NOTE: I didn't add the RENPY stuff you need to play the game with.
